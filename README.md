# Wordakshari_WordsWithFriends

In this project, we developed a Web-based Two Player Game that is very much like Antakshari. Antakshari is a popular parlor game played in India.
For those who donâ€™t know about Antakshari it is a game where one team starts with a song and opposite team have to sing a song with the ending letter of previous song. A team looses a point if they are not able to sing from that word.
Many word games are similar to antakshari. One such game is Wordakshari or Word with Friends.The game can be played by two people. The first player has to recite a word. The last letter of the word is then used by the next player to recite another word starting with that letter. The winner or winning team is decided by a process of elimination. The person or the team that cannot come up with a word with the right consonant is eliminated.
The following rules need to be followed while playing this game:
(i) All other words have to begin with the last letter of the previous word 
(ii) No words can be repeated. 
(iii) Each player will get 30 seconds to comeup with a word.
(iv) Words should be meaningful/ present in dictionary.
